Hey, You need to create directory and grant privilgies to read and write on this directory to yourself:
CREATE DIRECTORY LOGS AS '/Exercises/LOGS';
GRANT READ, WRITE ON DIRECTORY LOGS TO <username>;
I'm not sure that it's correct solution but it's how I work with logs in current job. If it's incorrect please let me know how to do this. I'm curious.
